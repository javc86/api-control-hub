# Api Fibonacci

It's an Api Rest with the an endpoint returns the fibonacci result like to indicate below:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/fibonacci/6
```

## Install

```shell
npm i
```

## Run
```shell
npm start
```

## Solution

For this solution, I use Nodejs and express because it's so easy to construct web app faster and scalable and flexible with the express framework.

For the fibonacci calculation I implemented a simple recursive functionality calculate the previous values in the fibonacci serie based a positive and integer number.

## Improvements

Restructure the project with typescript and patterns to improve the quality, sturdiness and typing.
